# Problem Statement:

#### Recently Manu visited the byteland. He was amazed with lots of different varieties of bytes he encountered there. Seeing this, he thought of a problem: 
Given an integer n, find out total possiblebit string (either 0 or 1) of length n which don't have two contiguous zeroes in them. For example if n
= 3, then total possible bit strings are 5 {010, 011, 101, 110, 111}. Now Manu started solving the problem but got busy with some important deployments. He asked you for the help. Please help him figure out the solution.

## Input Format:
First line of test case contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases.
In next t lines, each line contains an integer n, denoting the length of bit string.

## Output Format:
For t test cases, output the total number of bit string possible. Since this number can be very large,
output it modulo 10^9+7.

## Constraints: 1 <= t <= 10^3, 1 <= n <= 10^15
### Input Example:
 2
 2
 3
### Output Example:
 3
 5

## Solution :
